This project was based on two other boilerplates:
- https://github.com/brunolm/ts-react-redux-startup
- https://github.com/jpsierens/webpack-react-redux

## Run the app

0. ```npm install```
0. ```npm start:dev```

## Build the app
```npm run build```

This will build the app into the "dist" directory in the root of the project. It contains the index.html along with the minified assets, ready for production.

After built, you can use ```npm start``` in your production server.
